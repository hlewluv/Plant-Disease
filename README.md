# Plant-Disease
The project aims to develop an advanced IoT system for agriculture that measures soil moisture, monitors plant conditions via cameras, detects abnormalities, and automates irrigation. It also provides audio alerts for overwatering or underwatering, ensuring an optimal environment for plant growth and efficient agricultural management.
